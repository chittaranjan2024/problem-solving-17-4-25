Graph:
A Graph consists of :
 i)Vertices(nodes): Entities of a graph
 ii)Edges(links): connection between pair of vertices.
 
 
 Types of Graphs:
 
  i)Based on Direction : Directed(DGrapg), Undirected
  
  ii)Based on Edge weights: Weighted, Unweighted
  
  iii)Based on Cycles: Cyclic, Acyclic,  Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)
  
  iv)Connectedness: Connected, Strongly connected graph
  
  
  Graph Implementation:
  
  i)Adjacency Matrix
  ii)Adjacency List
  iii)Incidence Matrix
  
  
  Traversal Algorithm:
  i)DFS(Depth First Search)
  ii)BFS(Breadth First Search)
                  
                    BFS                 DFS
  
  Data structure:  Queue              Stack(Or recursion)
  Approach:        Level-order        Depth-first(go deep first)
  Speed:           Slower than DFS    DFS is faster than BFS
  Memory:          More memory space  DFS requires less memory space
    
    
    
    
    Detect cycle in an undirected graph:
    
    i)Maintain a visited[] array to track visited notes.
    ii)For every unvisited node we will do DFS:
       For every adjacent node 
        a)If it is not visited, recurse on it
        b)If it is visited and not present, cycle is detected
