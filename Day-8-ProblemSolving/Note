LinkedList:A LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory
locations. Instead, each element(also called Node) contains two parts.

i)The data 
ii)A Reference (a link to the next node)


Why use linkedlist?

i)Dynamic size:It can grow or shrink at runtime easily.
ii)Efficient insertion/deletion: Adding and removing nodes is very easy.


head--> [12,next]---->[23,next]----->[77,next]--->[67,next]---->[34, next]-->[25,next]
nodes: 4

[77,next]

[6,34,56,67,89,45]

Types of linkedlist
i)Singly ii)Doubly iii)Circular
